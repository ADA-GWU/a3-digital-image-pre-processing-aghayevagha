# Assignment 3

This repository contains the source code and images for Assignment 3.

## Structure

- `noisy/` â€” The folder provided by the instructor. Make sure it is in the same directory as the scripts.
- `utils.py` â€” Contains the filter and image processing functions.
- `task1-plot-outputs/` and `task2-plot-outputs/` â€” Contain the images for the report.
- Other scripts (`a1.py`, `a2.py`, `a3.py`) correspond to the assignment parts.

## Part 1

Based on a seed, I have chosen 3 random images. For each filtering function (kernel), the program randomly picks one of those 3 images.

Aside from techniques learned in class, I present my own approach which significantly outperforms other filters due to the nature of these images.

To simplify program structure, Iâ€™ve created a method map that links method names to their corresponding functions. You can save method results separately.

## Part 2

In this part, I provide only the best results based on qualitative analysis. You can run `a2.py` and experiment with different filters on the speckle images.

## Part 3

Run `a3.py`, which provides an interactive tool to view images in a loop (forward and backward). You can also use a slider to navigate through different image frames.

You can save filtered images by setting `save` to `True`. It will save the result under `outputs/output{assignment_number}/` using the `save_image` function.

You can also save the comparison plot by setting `save_plot` to `True`.

## How to Run
